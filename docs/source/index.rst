MetConSIN documentation
=====================================


**Met**\ abolic **Con**\ text **S**\ pecies **I**\ nteraction **N**\ etworks (MetConSIN) generates microbe-metabolte and metabolite-metabolite interaction networks using constraint based metabolic modeling. To do this, MetConSIN simulates with the dynamic FBA system and saves the sequence of interaction networks implied by that system, as well as the time-average network.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including how to
:ref:`install <installation>` the project. For an explaination of the method used by MetConSIN, see :doc:`method`.
